# Johns Barber Shop 

* Welcome to Johns Barber Shop repository.  This is non profit project that will help my barber back home in LA with his barbershop business.

# Project Description

```
Application that shows users how long it will take them to get a haircut with a certain barber.  If they don’t have a barber preference then they get the barber with the shortest queue.

Let’s think of a scenario. Someone comes into the shop and wants a haircut.  First of all, the user will have to pick what kind of haircut that they want.  This will be done via some ipad that is logged into the website. There can be a page on the website that allows the user to pick a combination of things that they want.  Then they will get to pick which barber that they get to go to. If they don’t have a preference then they will get automatically placed with the barber with the shortest queue. 

There will be two sides to this app, the barber side and the user client side. The barber gets to see who is in their queue.  Barbers will also be able to remove clients once they are done giving them a hair cut.  Users will see approximately how long it will take each barber to be done with their haircut. Barbers will also be able to pick what kind of haircut that they are receiving.
